> Khalid Ait Miloud , from Morocco. I am currently studying web development. I'm a believer in open-source and a part-time blogger. I mainly enjoy working with JS and Python. I like reading and listening to anything related to Software Development, watch Documentary and MMA fights. I also enjoy playing soccer as well as walking and running.

  hardWorker: true,
  quickLearner: true,
  problemSolver: true,
  hireable: function () {
    return this.hardWorker && this.problemSolver;
  },
};
